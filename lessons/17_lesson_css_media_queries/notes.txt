media queries allow you to modify your website based on specific charactersitcs
most often we look at browser viewport width this si key to reponsive website
the width of a device's viewport is very important to make the website responsive

firstly in the head if we lok we have a meta tag that enables a reponsive design that 
the one set to viewport this meta tag is imp to enable our responsive designs
with media queries

firt we lok at the syntax of the media query

Syntax:
@media media type and (condition: breakpoint) {
    css rules
}

in the asbove given syntax oif the media query we can see the syntax of the media query
we start with @media then we give media type and then we give conditions and then 
we provide the type of break point we need to add and there are lots of different types of
conditions and break points that we can add and the css rules that needed to be modified 
we add inside the curly brackets 

now as we write our first break point we see that we can write screen for media type and
and for condition we use min width this si a starttuing point it always starts from min 
minm width usually from and upto is the idea is to go from smallest to the largest that is 
the idea behind mobile first approch that your website be modified for the mobile screen
sizes 

so now that the media query value minwidth is set to 481px every thing before will applied 
accordingly but once it gets to 481 px every thing related css all the changes we have applied
will be changed accordingly now the ones that are changing will be changed on min with 481px
but other styles will not change and will be accordingly the ones that are not inside the 
media query

min width and max width are very common but you can also use other properties such as
orientation

so how do we decide the break points

we can see some css frameworks and see what they have done this will tellus some important braek point s to know
