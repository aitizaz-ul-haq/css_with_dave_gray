        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            <span>industry's</span>
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
            to
            make
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged.
