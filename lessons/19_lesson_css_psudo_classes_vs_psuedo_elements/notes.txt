in css we have psuedo class and psuedo elements so what is the difference between 
both of them

psuedo class selects an element that is in a specific state like for anchor tag if you look in the code
YOU WILL see the anchor tag psudo classes link visited hover and focus these are all specific states of
the element

psudo element is similar but they act like you have enterd a new element in to your html documnt
also psuedo element use two columns instead of one we use for psuedo classes 

is can be used to replace the multiple use of nav a selecttor we can use it so we dont repeat the use of nava in the css rule
we csn use this to apply dry code dry stands fro do not repeat

so if two classes are being used we can use any class as well to slect the psuedo classes we want 

with sleector classes we can also target the attribute an example of that would be img html selector 
in block parentheses we can set the alt to the selector and we can provide a css value to this will allow ust to 
apply the css rpoperty based on the attributes value now we can also see if the alt attibute does not have 
a value this we can do by using not 

another psudo class that we have used previously is the nth child class we have used it before 
with card but it is used only to select the number of card we want so if we set the value of nth child
to 2 we are selecting the second card in the html with class nth-child(2) value set to 2 nth child
can also recieve odd or even value as well

lets move on to psuedo elements

one of the psuedo elements we can create is after what after does is creates content after the 
first css rule has been added see in the example how this is possible smae egoes with before psuedo elemetn 
the content we added will be added before the css rule a perfect example of this is the quotres we can add them
open and closed before and after as well and also we can style them as we want like setting position relative
to give some sapcing and adding font size

another psudo element is the  first-letter we can use to access the first letter of p tag or any other thing

another psueod element to add is the first line we can use it to add styling to the first line as well
