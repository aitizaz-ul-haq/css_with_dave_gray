the display property is all about block level elements and inline level elements

paragraphs are block level elements

block level elements have 100% width automaticall the covered
100 % width also the block level elemnts will stack on top of each
other

span is an inline element we cannot apply top or bottom margin 
to an inline elmeent heigth can also not apply to inline elements
padding applies a little diifferently so by giving the display property
inline-block will allow us to apply the styles margin height and padding and will keep
the element inline with block properties applied to it

so conclusively block level elements stack on top of each inline elements 
do not stack on each other and do not create anew line when we get to the inline-block
we get some kind of a hybrid wecan apply all kinds of block level properties onthem

 it could be handy if we are trying to turn a link in to abutton
 or turning a list into a row

 list items are block level elements
