we can add columns to our html paragraphs with out grid and or
flexbox by using the column property and assigning to our sections containing paragraph

we can adjust the width of the colum nwe have set and this will alow us to adjust the width of the column the columns will now adjust according
to the value set

applying columns property allow usto add some spacing between the
parargraphs but its does so by adding margin automatically
if the css reset is not set the margins will be added automatically
what if we need to remove these margins what are we going to do

in css wehave some thing called margin collapsing this means
auto margin will not be applied doubled
