the css transform proerpty has two values to whom we provide the y and x axis
values these are translatex and trans late y we can provide % mor rem values
to it as well as in negetive value as well using x and y axis will move the 
object up and down we can also combine x and y values ina combination as well
that will apply x values first and y values second

another value for transform is rotate we have x y and z values for roratet as well
rotate z cvhanges teh orientation clockwise and anticlockwise

similarlay the transform scale expands to x or y values

another tranform value is skew this angels the div into one direction it has x and y values

another css property is transition we can apply it on hover psudo class we can set a background color 
value to transition and set a duration for background color to change also add delay time for tansition aswell
we also have a transition timing function css property that can help in timing the transition

css have a css property called animation that allows us to perform animations on html content
we can use this to animate objects in html and style them accordingly firstly we name our animation

now most of the properties that the animation takes are like transition but the key diff between transition
and animation is @keyframe with the name of animation this allows us to apply animation at different times
this will help us move objects with animation styles and this will allow us to apply the animations
from 0% to 100% that is the duration of time we have set to change the animation from diff parts 
to diff parts
