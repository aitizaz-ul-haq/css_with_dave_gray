css rule set

p {
    font-size: 64px;
    color: purple;
}

p is the html selector
inside the curly bracket is the declaration
font-size is property and its value is its value

this is as a whole is called a css rule


in css wrong spelling amounts to error any spellling mistakes mean 
css will ignore it

we can use w3c validator to validate our css files
