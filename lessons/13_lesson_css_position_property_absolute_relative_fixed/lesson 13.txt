the default position of elements is static so if you set
position property to static it will be set to default

when we change the value of position to absolute there wont be any changes
becuase we need to set the values for top left bottom right 
as well absolute positioning needs a relative parent meaning
that the absolute position property if not given a parent relative value ie 
the containre conatining the absolute element will use the 
screen as a realtive and set it self as we saw with box left 0
top 0 value but when we give the container a relative value to
position the box inside the conatiner now has a refrence to its
absolute positioning and it will set left and top values
according to the conatiner rather than browser screen if we set 
have multiple acsectors to an absolute element and we set all
ancestors to relative the element whos position is set to 
absolute will pick the closeset one to that absolute element
to be relative top 0 and left 0 are default values if we give it
other we can see it moves inside the closeset relative ancestors
accordint to the values given 

no w for relative container if we set position to relative and the 
element is already inside the relative elment and no ancestor is required
the element we set to relative can be provided the left and right
value this will enable the position accordint to left and right
values provided

for the position fixed we see that an element thats position is set
to fixed the element would not move and stay fixed even if we scroll it
will staty fixed at its position as the name sujjests the postion 
is fixed out of the flow of the page 

it can get confusing but the absolute block is on top the 
css is layered and so absolute comes first so it is on the first
layer so it will be on top of any overlapping css elements
but some times we need to put some element on top of 
the first one in this case the absolute is on top and weneed to put|
fixed on top so we can do that by using z-index

the last one is sticky sticky is alot like fixed but it is differnet
than fixed because it will stay at the sopt you have defined
when we provide the sticky postion a value it will stick to that value but once
it runs out of the container during scrolling it will stop and move up wards with the rest of
the container during scrolling
