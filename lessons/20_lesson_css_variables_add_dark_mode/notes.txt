css varibles are very important and very use full imagine if we have a very large 
project which means a very large css file

for example if have a hex color code and we are using this again and again in our project
we are definatly going to repeat using it so we have to copy paste it again and agiain
and when the req changes and we are instructed to change the color then what 
we are going to have to change every single color code 

but when we use css variables we only have to change it in one place 

we will create another section call it variableas and use a css psuedo class
called root we have not used it yet the root psuedo class every thing inherits from that class
even html it is referncin gthe document root so we put it at the top

we will start with the colors 

creating variables will start from  a name it starts with a -- before the name you
can use upper case ort lower case but it is upto you using uppercase is good we proviDE 
this variable with a value like the hex color and then to provide this value to the 
css rule as a property we use var() and in it we mention the variable name this will
automatically lkike as in javascript will give the css rule teh value of the variable
whcih is the hex color 

its okay to create two variables with two values

vs code helps you with adding the variables you wrtite var and teh vs code helps in adding 
variables in properties

we can use css colors for more then just colors

we in body html selector has the font property and there is a short hand where the font size
and font family both values are we can define a variabel and use it to store both in it

we are not limited to just colors and font sizes we can put other stuff into variables 
and use it accordingly 

like padding we can see in nav selector thaht nav has a padding of 1.5em so 
we can create a variable to store the value of this as well so we can apply the paddingto 
other parts as well

so what if we want to use apply shadow property we are going to need to apply all 
four axis vaslues and color to it so what if we wnat to provide the same shadow 
in other places we create a variabel for it now when we define a variable we can use value
from another variable as well we can use the same concept fro our borders as well

while creating html content first define the css variables for its styling normally
that is how it is done but you can define after if you wan to 

we can also change the value of a vriable in the middle of a css rule set now when we give 
a new value to a variable it will ony be applied to that specific class where the value 
is cahnges like in highligt class we change teh value of background color so we will
be changing the value of square high light as well

a feature that css vraible makes easier to implement and is in high demand is the dark
mode 

so to add a dark mode we have to define a seperate color theme 

by adding a media query and giving it a value to perefer color sheme light ot dark 
and creating a new root in it we can add the colors that are dark now what ever value we have set
in windows as light or dark the browser will prefer that one and render css accordingly 
so teh dark mode will be added to our page according to our os prefrences
