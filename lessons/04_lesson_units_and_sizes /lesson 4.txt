units determine the size of every thing in the page they are very importat

px or pixels is the most common value that we will use to apply sizing it is a unit that is applied
most of the time universally

we dont want use an absoulute font size on a page like px so when we use
px we use it for others sunc as borders and other sizing properties that require px numeric value
these not effect the text on the web page rather the content

another important unit for values is percentage it represents a fraction of some other values

for sizing our block level elements we can definatly use percentage because the 
percentage will aplly to original value of the box sizing set to the 
block element if a nested html element has been given the percentage it will calculate the
parent element s width and then apply the percentage value to it

the rem unit is used typically for the font sizing 1 rem is set by default by
the browser the browser sets the rut which is the r in rem and so when ever weset
et the value of font using it will look at the broser set value of rut
which by default is 1rem so 2 rem would mean we are doiubling the value set by the
browser 

another usint is em whcih we can use to set the font value the em as a reference
looks at the rem value now in main if we set the value to 2 rem 1 em would be
amplified beyond our requirement so when do we use em we use it for margin and padding
also for buttons we can set the font size using rem and then go ahead at set the
padding and or margin using em

another unit is ch this sets the value by looking at a value that already exists
applies to it

ther si something called the default styling that the browsers does and doing so the 
the browser basically cancels out some tof the styling in perticular the units values 
we have set to default this is because the browser has detemioned that some values
would not appropirate so it by default changes the values of some units in eorticular the elements
that we have set we can use the universel selector and set some rules in it such as
setting the margin and padding to 0 this has enabled all default padding and margin to 0 all
the default values applied by the browser are now set to zero meaning the browser has now no 
input on these values this is a way to reset the default stylings applied by the browser
another imp property is the boxsizing that we have set to border box

another unit that we have is the viewport units which are basically used for the 
width and height this is importatn because many times we come accross the 
problem of setting the width and height units so we use the viewport units to adjustt them
but despite it handling the width and height the percentage is a better choice in terms of 
width and height adjustments
