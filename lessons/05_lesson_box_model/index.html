            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                <span>industry's</span>
                standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
                to
                make
                a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged.
