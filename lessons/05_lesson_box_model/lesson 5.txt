every thing in css is a box


the box model consossts of from outside to inside margin represented in orenge in
inspect tools in chrome then border then padding
in green and then content in blue this whole thing is
is called the box model the browser set sthe default
margin and some tims the paadding on the box model


so avoid the browsers default settings what we do is we would very much like toset our own values of margins and 
padding in em the way we wnat it fro that we 
can use the universal selector and that will
allow us to apply our own custom box model
values with out the browsers input

so for border box option in css reset if we set to the 
content-box value what will happen that all the other\
box model values will be included in the content but if we set
it to border box all the other values will be added to the final
size of the thing
