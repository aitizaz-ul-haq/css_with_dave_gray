we have already used functions before in our css if you go ahead and look at the 
hsl and rgb colors you will see that they have values function values as well
so these are color functions

we also already have used gradient function as well as we provided it values 
such as colors and size url is another functions

these are css functions there are many css functions

there are math functions in css as well in font size we can use min function as well 
instead providing it with a value  min(2.25rem, 3vh) in this we define the font size
but also the height which is 3vh so when set these values we will se that 
during responsiveness the font size will not go down or exceed and the hight will 
also remain 3 vh when we make the size of the screen larger it wont go higher then this 
this is the use of min function

the opposite to min is max the max function will choose the large of teh 2 values
 max(1.75rem, 3vh) same principle as min you have one absoulute value like 1.75rem 
 value and one relative value that has the ability to adjust according to itself 
 that would be 3vh

 clamp is a newer function that takes both min and max value  

 another function we can use is the filter function for adjusting the brightness
 other than then rgba or opacity this allows us to apply opacity and brioghtnmess
 with more effectiveness

 we can create a custom tooltipe as well using the attr function that will provide us the 
 value of the toolitp data attribute we can create a text from the tooltip attribute 
 so these this wiil and other css values will allow us to create a tooltip
