block elements stack on top of each other but when we float
an element it will take that element out of thenormal flow of the page
and then we can see other elemetns wrapping around the floated
element

but since the floated element is not inside the normal flow 
the margin will not be applied effectively

if floating elemetns are inside a container they might over flow so because of that over flow they |
have to be handled inside the container for that we can set the over flow to auto
for the contianer this will let the contasinre to adjust the over flowing element but
that is the legacy way of handling the over flow another 
way os to use display properties flow root
