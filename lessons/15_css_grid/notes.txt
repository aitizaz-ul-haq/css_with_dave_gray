there could be several different ways to use grid we will discuss them all

to use grid set continer value to display grid 

the first thing we need to defeine for grid is the grid flow it can be row or column

the grid flow property is simple and does not define accurate amount of size for a column
so we can use grid template column as well this will allow us to set grid to 
column as well as set values for it we dont nessercarilly have to use px we
can use fr or fraction to define the spacing this will allow the grid items to take all the space and adjust according to 
fr fraction values instead of defining each column we can set a value for all the columns ising the
repeat property first value in repeat is number of columns in row and then there second value
is about the fraction value between them

now to define each rows we can use grid-auto-rows property this will help us
define the the values for the rows again we cannot define and provide a hard coded value for this
so we can use a css function minmax this lets us to say minimum value first 

same values aexist for the template-grid-row 

we can also set gaps between rows using row-gap and also column -gap as well we can laso just use|
gap that will define all the spacing around the columns and rows

there are some grid psudo selector classes we need to see as well one is first child
this allows us to select the first child which then we can apply background colos property
so we can define where the start of the column is by proviing it a value and we can 
also define where does it end also by a value this will drasticlly change the size of 
the column as we have now defined its size its not just columns we can also do teh same with the row
using row properties 

just like flexbox we can nest grid inside a grid container as well and just like 
flexbox we have all three properties align-items align-content and also justify-content
and for justify content and align content both what we can do is we can use both
as shorthand property we can use place-content property this will give us both the values for them

there is another way of adding grid we can apply grid to html by proving the classes
with grid values as seen in example code
