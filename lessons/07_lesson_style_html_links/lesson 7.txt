links are styled auto matically depending on there state
if they are not visited they will show up in blue if a link 
is visited or clicked it will turn to purple as to signal 
that it has been visited also by default links are underlined
to signal that that part of the text is a link

another default setting in links is when you keep pressing mouse on it it will turn to requiredmeaning there 
is another property there that can be styled


there are some classes called sudo classes these are basicallyt 
the classes that are representing the default styling on the
an html element we can not only override them but completly change them
according to our requirement 

anchor tags psuedo classes should be edited in a sequecne
because any other sequence will overrride uther classes
