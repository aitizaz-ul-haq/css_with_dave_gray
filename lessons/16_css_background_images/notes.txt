images are inline elements they are not block level elements and thtass why they auto matically 
have spacong that was invisionmed because they were going to be used in paragraphs
we can set it to a block l;evel element to remove that spacing

basic way of making an image reponsive is to provide it with a container we can do that
with html figure tag and give the figure a value becuase it is a container it must have
a default width when the screen size is full also using percentage is also a good idea because then the
continer will fit it self according to scren size so that it has some space now that the image has 
a continer we can go ahead and fill the continer

once a continer for the responsive image has been set we can go ahead and add the image to the continer
now the image would require some proeprtise to become fully responsieve setting the width 100% will
make the image fill up the continer also the percentage value will ensure that 
the image adjust the width automatically according to the screen size also setting 
height auto would defionalty adjust the hiehgt automatically by looking at the
width that is set percecntage 100% then we can add some border values as well to the image 

if we have a caption to our figure container we can use the flex box property to change its position 
left or right by using the wrap property of the flex

we can set an image as background image but before that we need to set a color if image is not available 
so we set a background color this is important once the back ground is set we can add the background image
using the background color property url needs to be provided to add an image in the back ground

background repeat values allow to set where the background image is to repeat where should it not
reapeat so we have to 
set value to repeat to stop repeating or to set an axis of repeat

if we change background image to some thing else we will se it looks good but the font now 
doe snot look so good we have to emphesize on the font because teh font is the most important hing
the font has to be visible if we have a tranparent image of the background image we can set the background
we see the transparent image will make it look cool mix with the background image we set earlier

now if we set a larger background image we see that it covers some part of the image is shown while the rest
is hidden that is becuas ethe image is too big and cannot ft completly in the backg round for that
tyo adjust that we have some thing called background-size css property and set its value to cover 
now what will happen is that the background image will cover the entire background another property is contain
what will now happen that the image will be contained in its entirety 

now some times we need to display a n image that is even bigger and has a higher resolution this case we
we need to set some rules one rule is that we need to set an image that is atleast twice the size becuase of devices some devices 
have lower amount of pixels and this could blur the image this is no good so a rule of thumnbis to set double 
the image size

again despite the background images being added the most important thing always will be the font in front of
it the font needs to pop out it should be visible that ever we can apply some text related stuff like giving the text 
a diff color and or giving it some shadow most of the time instead of making the text better we could
put a filter of color over the background what this will do is set a shade oint he background and make the 
text pop a little more

another important property is background position to move the image

we can also set back ground image to the boday the whole body but before that there is something calleed
linear gradient linear gradient allows us to use multiple colors mixes them up in a linear fatsion what we
can also do is that we can use this linear fashion an change its direction accordin to requirements

there is anothe very important background image property thatt is background clip what it does that it
peojects background image to the front inside the large text but the background clip property is not stuff
supported by alot of browsers so we can use webkit to enable it to be used once the property is addedf we see that
the background image can be scene in side the text
